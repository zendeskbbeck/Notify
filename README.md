# Notify

Notify provides an easy way for agents to be notified when an end user's information needs to be updated. By changing a setting on the user profile, agents will be notified in the top-right corner of their screen that the user profile needs to be updated.

### Setup Instructions

* When setting up the app, create a custom user field with two options. The keys for these two options should be yes_update (for when the user needs updating) or no_update (for when the user does not need to be updated)

### Questions?

* Please submit questions or bug reports to [Brian Beck](bbeck@zendesk.com). Pull requests are welcome.
